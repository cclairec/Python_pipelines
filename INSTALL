NIPYPE: Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces
========================================================

*Nipype*, an open-source, community-developed initiative under the
umbrella of NiPy, is a Python project that provides a uniform interface
to existing neuroimaging software and facilitates interaction between
these packages within a single workflow. Nipype provides an environment
that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms from different
packages (e.g., SPM, FSL, FreeSurfer, AFNI, Slicer), eases the
design of workflows within and between packages, and reduces the
learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype is creating a
collaborative platform for neuroimaging software development in a
high-level language and addressing limitations of existing pipeline
systems.

*Nipype* allows you to:

* easily interact with tools from different software packages
* combine processing steps from different software packages
* develop new workflows faster by reusing common steps from old ones
* process data faster by running it in parallel on many cores/machines
* make your research easily reproducible
* share your processing workflows with the community



Installation
-------------

Nipype is a python extension. The user needs top install the following packages
prior to install nipype

* git http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
* python 2.x https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/
* SQLite http://www.sqlite.org/download.html
* GraphVix http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php

The next step is to install some python packages either through apt-get on Debian, MacPorts 
on MacOSX, or using python tools such as easy_install or pip. Here is the list of required 
packages:

numpy / scipy / traits / dateutil / sphinx / nibabel / networkx / six (/nose) / matplotlib / dipy

Then you would be ready to install the nipype repository that we put in place on https://github.com/ntoussaint/nipype.git

Follow those following OS specific steps for installing and using nipype and niftk interfaces:

MacOSX
-------------
On a terminal, type the following commands

1) Install MacPorts: https://www.macports.org/install.php
2) sudo port install git python27 sqlite3 graphviz py27-ipython py27-numpy py27-scipy py27-traits py27-dateutil py27-sphinx py27-nibabel py27-networkx py27-six py27-nose py27-matplotlib; sudo easy_install dipy
3) cd $HOME/Projects/; git clone https://github.com/ntoussaint/nipype.git nipype; cd nipype; sudo python setup.py install
3) cd ~/Projects/NifTK/src; git fetch niftymidas; git checkout dev
5) Add the following lines in your $HOME/.bash_profile:

NIFTK_SRC_DIR=$HOME/Projects/NifTK/src
PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:.
PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$NIFTK_SRC_DIR/Code/pipelines/nipype/interfaces
export PYTHONPATH

Debian
-------------
On a terminal, type the following commands

1) sudo apt-get install git sqlite3 python python-dev ipython python-dateutil python-six python-nibabel python-networkx python-dipy python-scipy python-traits python-sphinx python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose graphviz
2) cd ~/Projects/; git clone https://github.com/ntoussaint/nipype.git nipype; cd nipype; sudo python setup.py install
3) cd ~/Projects/NifTK/src; git fetch niftymidas; git checkout dev
4) Add the following lines in your $HOME/.bashrc

NIFTK_SRC_DIR=$HOME/Projects/NifTK/src
PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:.
PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$NIFTK_SRC_DIR/Code/pipelines/nipype/interfaces
export PYTHONPATH
